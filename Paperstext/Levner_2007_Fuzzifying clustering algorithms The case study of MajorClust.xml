been proposed so far, the most useful are those that automatically reveal the number of clusters and assign each target document to exactly
one cluster. However, in many real situations, there not exists an exact
boundary between different clusters. In this work, we introduce a fuzzy
version of the MajorClust algorithm. The proposed clustering method
assigns documents to more than one category by taking into account
a membership function for both, edges and nodes of the corresponding
underlying graph. Thus, the clustering problem is formulated in terms
of weighted fuzzy graphs. The fuzzy approach permits to decrease some
negative effects which appear in clustering of large-sized corpora with
noisy data.
