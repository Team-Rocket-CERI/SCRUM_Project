ROUGE stands for Recall-Oriented Understudy for
Gisting Evaluation. It includes measures to automatically determine the quality of a summary by
comparing it to other (ideal) summaries created by
humans. The measures count the number of overlapping units such as n-gram, word sequences, and
word pairs between the computer-generated summary to be evaluated and the ideal summaries created by humans. This paper introduces four different
ROUGE measures: ROUGE-N, ROUGE-L, ROUGE-W,
and ROUGE-S included in the ROUGE summarization evaluation package and their evaluatio ns. Three
of them have been used in the Document Understanding Conference (DUC) 2004, a large-scale
summarization evaluation sponsored by NIST.
