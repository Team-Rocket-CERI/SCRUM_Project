        <abstract>Abstract. Among various document clustering algorithms that have
                    been proposed so far, the most useful are those that automatically reveal the number of clusters and assign each target document to exactly
                    one cluster. However, in many real situations, there not exists an exact
                    boundary between different clusters. In this work, we introduce a fuzzy
                    version of the MajorClust algorithm. The proposed clustering method
                    assigns documents to more than one category by taking into account
                    a membership function for both, edges and nodes of the corresponding
                    underlying graph. Thus, the clustering problem is formulated in terms
                    of weighted fuzzy graphs. The fuzzy approach permits to decrease some
                    negative effects which appear in clustering of large-sized corpora with
                    noisy data.
